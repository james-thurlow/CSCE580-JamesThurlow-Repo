Medical Diagnosis Chatbot

This chatbot interacts with the user where the user can enter symptoms
he/she is feeling and the chatbot compares the symptoms to a database of diseases 
to determine what illness the patient may have. The chatbot assignes a value to
each disease based on the user's symptom and returns the disease with the highest 
value. Higher values are associated with higher likelyhood of having said disease.
